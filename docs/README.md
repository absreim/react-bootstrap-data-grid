Reference application for testing the build products for React Bootstrap Data
Grid (https://react-bootstrap-data-grid.vercel.app/).

## Getting Started

Install NPM packages:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Navigate to the location at which the site is being served (usually http://localhost:3000). If a functioning data grid
component is visible, then you have some confidence that the installed version of React Bootstrap Data Grid works
properly.

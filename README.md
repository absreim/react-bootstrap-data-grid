# Introduction

This is the repository for React Bootstrap Data Grid.

Inspired by [react-bootstrap-table2](https://react-bootstrap-table.github.io/react-bootstrap-table2/)
and [MUI X Data Grid](https://mui.com/x/react-data-grid/),
React Bootstrap Data Grid aims to fill the specific niche of a data grid
UI component for the combination of Bootstrap and React.

# Project Structure

The project currently consists of a documentation site built with the [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) framework with live
examples of the data grid.

As a project not yet ready for release, the data grid component is exported to an NPM package for use in other projects.

The documentation site is located at `src/app` while the data grid component is located at `src/grid`.

# Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

After modifying the files for documentation site and/or the data grid component, you should be able to see the results
in your browser as the NextJS development server automatically refreshes the page your browser in response to changes
in the files.
